<br/>

<h3>Kimi no Na Wa</h3>
<p>This movie has very high rating on MAL, and for a very good reason</p>
<p>Prepare for emotional ride full of swings, apexes, tears and laughter.</p>

<H3>Any kind of Top Gear Special</H3>
<p>Never-ending fun of british trio, traveling together across the world</p>

<h3>Collateral beauty</h3>
<p>Will Smith can even make emotional movies, which will slap you like he did to that guy on Grammys</p>
